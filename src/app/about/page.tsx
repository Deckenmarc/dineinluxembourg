            <p>
              DineINLuxembourg was founded in 2020 by a group of food-loving friends who were tired of seeing the same restaurant recommendations on major review sites. What started as a passion project has grown into a trusted resource for thousands of diners looking to explore Luxembourg's diverse culinary landscape.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Over the years, we've expanded our coverage to include all cities and cuisines in Luxembourg, always maintaining our commitment to quality recommendations and honest insights.
